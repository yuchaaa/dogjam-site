**<u>dogJam (29/30) is recruiting, rankers prioritised</u>**

## __About Us__
dogJam is a retirement home for veterans that still play a fair amount of GW but would like a more relaxed atmosphere. We do top 300 in prelims then after that, aim to secure top 2500 in crew totals.

## __What we offer__
- We share GW strats for those looking to cycle NMs faster, everything we do revolves around JST timezone and there is no morning rush enforced.
- An army of Zeds; the army also clears your SUBHL hosts when available.
- A Discord server with a tight-knit community that shares common interests (e.g. GW cooking, other gacha games, eroge, gooning, professional racism, shitposting etc.), we also play party games on an occasional basis.
- The usual crew bonuses (buffs, maxed ships) and a maxed crew resort island.
- We do high-difficulty raids pretty often with a very high success rate, ranging from SUBHL to Dark Rapture Zero since there's a constant demand for them.
- Degeneracy, lots and lots of degeneracy; we're also doing Hentai Heat every GW where we -partake in some culture.
- Deer's GF leaks in 3D channel :YepCock:
- No validation for your sub-optimal playstyle!

## __Requirements__
- You like playing GBF, are willing to improve your play and have a good attitude towards GW.
- Contribute enough to securing top 300 in prelims (about 250m depending on GW post-Celestials), whether if it's by meat farming or spamming NM90s.
- Need to show that you are capable of securing top 90k individuals; we will check your previous GW performances.
- You must be Rank 250 and over
- Have acceptable grids and setups in general, Magna or Primal is okay too
- Don't come off as an absolute brainlet (we already house enough of them).
- Play out the rounds during the evening hours (JST) if the round looks winnable.
- Be active in our server, because this is not just a crew server - we house retired players and fellow competitive players in here too so we're a pretty active bunch.
- Have a good sense of humor and not be overly sensitive, don't take jokes too seriously - it's not a dick
- Have a steering wheel, our danchou does not have one so his FOs are staging a coup on him GG
