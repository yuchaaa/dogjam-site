> We got fucked in the ass

-Kot

It's been a full cycle since our first ever GW, great work as always bros - we had a humorous matchup to kick us off, facing an Overlord-themed crew and then destroying them while we were at it. We were so close to getting a 4-0 GW but we got hella unlucky with the day 4 matchmaking; sad but it is what it is \:fbkgrin\: (and no I didn't get Raziel the entire GW so I might just chargeback and get my Buyee account rekt later)

Looks like they really wanted to drive home the narrative that Dirt is probably the worst ele in the game with how many players were missing stuff left and right, breaking their setups and god is it extremely clicky as well, hopefully it gets better next time but we all know they won't do that... with how many rankers we had this time we still ended up in the top 300 for crew totals as well.

Whether if you were in as a merc or looking to stay for the long-term, we appreciate your efforts in keeping the crew afloat; we originally struggled a lot just to secure top 2.5k in our first GW due to lack of members, fast forward to now and we've maintained a pretty strong track record this year for a top 300 retirement crew. 

Anyway, honorable mentions to @MAMOUMAMOUMAMOUMAMOUMAMOUMAMOU @Swidge and @MANBO OMATSURI MANBO for bloating the boat this time around - bloated so hard that most of the crew did not have to help keep up the lead against some night rush crews; latter two especially for their first Hero finishes, congrats! 

Thank you all for your efforts thus far, and here's to another few more üçª GGs bois
